  <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#7_Clinicians_should_evaluate_benefits" target="_blank">Recommendation #7:</a></p>
  <p>
      <strong>Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of
      starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should
      evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or
      more frequently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy,
      clinicians should optimize other therapies and work with patients to taper opioids
      to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4)</em>.</strong>
