/*
**  Recommendation #10
**    When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, providers should use urine drug
**    testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at
**    least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled
**    prescription drugs and illicit drugs (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4)
**
**  When
**    Provider is prescribing an opioid analgesic with ambulatory misuse potential in the outpatient setting
**    Prescription is for treating chronic pain.
**    Opioid review is useful for this patient:
**      Patient is 18 or over
**      Patient does not have findings indicating limited life expectancy
**      Patient does not have orders for therapies indicating end of life care
**      Patient is not undergoing active cancer treatment:
**        Patient has had at least 2 encounters within the past year with any diagnosis of cancer
**    Urine drug screening has not been performed in last 12 months
**  Then
**    Recommend urine drug screening
**      Will perform urine screening
**      Not for subacute or chronic pain management, snooze 3 months
**      N/A - see comment, snooze 3 months
