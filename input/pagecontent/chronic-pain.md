Determining whether a patient is being prescribed opioids for subacute or chronic pain is difficult to determine by examination of the medical record alone. The project team identified the following proxies for subacute or chronic pain, used throughout the recommendations:

1. A medication is considered for subacute or chronic pain if it is being prescribed for 28 days or more.

1. A medication is considered for acute pain if it is being prescribed for less than 28 days.
